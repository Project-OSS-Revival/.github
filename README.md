We are OSS Revival, an international team operating across EMEA and APAC, dedicated to reviving and maintaining projects that have fallen out of active development both downstream and, in some cases, upstream. Our goal is to provide long-term support for these projects, ensuring their stability and continuity. We are committed to following the established guidelines and best practices to align with the project's vision and contribute effectively to its sustainability.
